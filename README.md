- [Deployment Checklist](DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md) - Pre-deployment verification steps
- [Database Setup](DATABASE_SETUP.md) - Database configuration and initialization

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Material-UI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with multi-tenant support
- **Deployment**: Render (Static Hosting recommended)
- **Build**: Optimized production builds with all static assets

## 🚀 Deployment

The application is optimized for deployment on Render using static hosting:

1. **Push code to GitHub** - Automatic deployment will trigger
2. **Static hosting** - Faster and more reliable than Docker
3. **All static files included** - No more 404 errors on icons
4. **Production optimized** - Minified builds with proper caching

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If you encounter deployment issues:

1. **Run local build verification**: `./scripts/build-prod.sh`
2. **Check static files**: Ensure all icon files are present in `public/` and `build/`
3. **Use static hosting**: Docker deployment is temporarily disabled due to static file issues
4. **Check Render logs**: Monitor build and deployment logs in Render dashboard
